# Wave containers plugin for Nextflow 

Next generation container provisioning for cloud-native data analysis pieplines 

### Rationale

Containers are an essential part of data analysis in the cloud. Building and delivering optimized, context-aware container images slows down development. Wave is a container provisioning service designed for use with data analysis applications such as Nextflow. It allows for the on-demand assembly, augmentation, and deployment of containerized images based on task requirements.
